An enjoyable programming language of the future *(read: not implemented yet)*.

The interpreter for this language is probably going to be created very slowly,
and the repository is probably going to be mainly made up of markdown files. I
feel like if I just write down every thought that goes into making **pleasant**
work well, I will be able to understand the progress I've made, and mistakes
will be much easier to spot.

So, let's have a look at what we need to create: a programming language. A
language for writing programs. Here's a program written in **pleasant**, or at
least the language I want **pleasant** to become:

```
fn doubleAndPrint = x ->
  print x
  return x * 2
```

It looks a bit like CoffeeScript. I haven't written much CoffeeScript, but I
like the look of its syntax.
